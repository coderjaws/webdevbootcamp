#Intro to Node 

*What is Node? 
-MOst trendy things in Web Developement
-Empowered JavaScript to be written beyond the front end in the browser; it can be written everywhere!
-Node is how developers/Engineers run on the server side/backend

*Why does it matter?
-It's popular!(not the reason but one that can't be overlooked/ignored)
-Node is something that existing developers/engineers/senior engineers have picked up on the side
-It's in JavaScript!!! Since JS has been learned already, it's been continued on now on the backside and now we can write JS to do serverside work!!

*(It doesn't really matter(long term))
-Node is a great first serverside language because JavaScript has already been learned in this course; once you learn node, any other serverside language 
can be grasped easily.:)
