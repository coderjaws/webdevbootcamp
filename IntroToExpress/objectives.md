#Intro To Express

*What is a Framework? How is different from a library?
-A framework is an inversion of control; unlike a library that you can call, the framework calls you. 
with a library, you are in control; with a framework, you are only filling in little white spots for your code. 
-Frameworks dont remove creativity from the developer; they take all of the ground work stuff a developer does and 
pre-pakages it so a developer doesn't have to do the ground work all over again. 

*What is Express? 
-Express is a type of web application developement framework. It is the glue that keeps everything together. 

*Why are we using Express?
-Express is by far the most popular web developement framework- the most downloads on npm, the most contributors on github, 
making a large community of people who are using it and a wide amount of resources to help in learning it.
-Express is a lightweight framework- it requires you to know what is going on in order to get the work done;
if taught a heavyweight framework(i.e.Rails for Ruby), students never really learn how to use other frameworks 
because there's very little to do to write code in Ruby.  Express allows you to learn what is happening and how it works, 
which will help make learning new/other frameworks easier. Express is flexible, allowing you to do things you want.
